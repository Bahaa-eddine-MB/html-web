  <p>Inferno is a beloved map in CS:GO, known for its intricate design and strategic depth. The map features narrow
    alleys, tight corners, and key areas such as the Apartments, Banana, and both bomb sites, making it a challenging
    yet rewarding experience for players on both sides.</p>

        <p>A Site - Located near the Apartments and Pit, A Site is a complex area with multiple angles and cover points.
          It's crucial for Terrorists to clear out defenders from spots like Graveyard and Balcony, while
          Counter-Terrorists need to hold their ground and manage potential attacks from Short and Long.</p>

        <p>B Site - Situated at the end of the Banana, B Site is often a high-risk, high-reward area. The site is
          protected by narrow choke points and is a favorite for intense skirmishes. Control of the Banana area is
          critical for both teams, as it provides direct access to the site and is key for successful bomb plants or
          defenses.</p>
