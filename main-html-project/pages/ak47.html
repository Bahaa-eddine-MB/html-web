  <p>The M4A1-S is a silenced assault rifle available exclusively to the Counter-Terrorist side in CS
    . Known for its accuracy and low recoil, the M4A1-S is an excellent choice for players who prefer precision over
    power. The built-in suppressor not only reduces the weapon's noise but also minimizes its muzzle flash, making it
    easier to stay undetected. With a lower magazine capacity compared to its counterpart, the M4A4, the M4A1-S requires
    careful ammo management. It excels in medium to long-range engagements, offering consistent damage output and a
    manageable recoil pattern, making it a reliable choice for defensive playstyles.</p>
